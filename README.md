# Detection of Statistical Arbitrage using Machine Learning Techniques in NYSE: AI Stocks
## Project Overview:
* The goal of this project is to deploy machine learning models to detect statistical arbitrage opportunities in the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). By leveraging machine learning techniques, we aim to identify patterns and signals that can indicate potential arbitrage opportunities in NYSE-listed stocks. We will utilize regression and time delay neural network techniques for our analysis.

  
## Project Phases:
* Pick an Asset: NVDA
* Component stock: SMCI
* Historical Data API: 2015-2024: use their daily returns
* Develop a trading algorithm based on multiple regression models:
 

## Procedure:
* Analysis of AI Computer sector stocks using regression to model an index.
* Assessment of the index's correlation with the target stock (NVIDIA Corp).
* Prediction of market price based on historical data.
  
 
## Prediction Using Neural Networks 
* Time series modeling using historical stock prices 
* Utilization of Nonlinear Auto Regressive (NAR) for predictions
* Training algorithm: Levenberg-Marquardt backpropagation 
* Evaluation for different network structures and time delays
 

## Data Analysis 
   * SVR Model: Support Vector Regression is a powerful machine learning algorithm used for regression tasks
   * LSTM NEURAL NETWORK: Long Short-Term Memory is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture that is particularly effective in learning and predicting sequences of data. 
   * Logistic Regression: Logistic Regression is a type of statistical model used for binary classification tasks, where the target variable has two possible outcomes.
   * PAIRS TRADING MODEL: Pairs Trading is a quantitative trading strategy that seeks to exploit the historical correlation between two assets by taking simultaneous long and short positions in them.
   * OLS MODEL: Ordinary Least Squares is a series model for volatility forecasts and statistical arbitrage linear model and inference and prediction. 
 
 
## Model Accuracy 
* Logistic Regression: accuracy = 75%
* Entry & Exit Signals: Correlation = 88.5%
* Mean Absolute Error(MAE): 6.72552
 

## Future Work:
* Increase the level of accuracy between the target and component stock.
* Add more component stocks:  MFST, GOOGL, META, AMD, MRVL, AVGO, ANET, ALAB, AAPL, AMZN, PLTR, INTC, SOUN

## Dataset and Source Code:
* Data obtained from the NASDAQ Historical Data section.
* Source code for neural network obtained from Matlab Neural Network Toolbox.
