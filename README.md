# Detection of Statistical Arbitrage using Machine Learning Techniques in NYSE : AI Stocks
## Project Overview:
* The goal of this project is to deploy machine learning models to detect statistical arbitrage opportunities in the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). By leveraging machine learning techniques, we aim to identify patterns and signals that can indicate potential arbitrage opportunities in NYSE-listed stocks. We will utilize regression and time delay neural network techniques for our analysis.
## Project Phases:
* Detection of Arbitrage using Least Square Regression:
* Pick an Asset: NVDA
* Component stocks: MFST, GOOGL, META, AMD, MRVL, AVGO, ANET, ALAB,
SMCI, AAPL, AMZN, PLTR, INTC, SOUN, 
* Historical Data API : 2015-2024 : use their daily returns
* Establish communication channels and project management tools.
## Procedure:
* Analysis of AI Computer sector stocks using regression to model an index.
* Assessment of index's correlation with the target stock (NVIDIA Corp).
* Prediction of market price based on historical data.


## Prediction using Neural Networks:
* Time series modeling using historical stock prices.
* Utilization of Nonlinear Auto Regressive Neural Network (NAR) for prediction.
* Training algorithm: Levenberg-Marquardt backpropagation.
* Evaluation of prediction accuracy for different network structures and time delays.



## Future Work:

## Dataset and Source Code:
* Data obtained from NASDAQ Historical Data section.
* Source code for neural network obtained from Matlab Neural Network Toolbox.
